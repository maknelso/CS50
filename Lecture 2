Lecture 2 - Arrays (done in C)

Starting in 54:33 - dynamically asking for score and giving you an average

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

float average(int length, int array[]);            //telling compiler there is a f(x) average
int main(void)
{
    int n = get_int("Number of scores: ");         //step 1: ask how many assignments    

    int scores[n];                                 //step 2: array

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)                    //step 3: prompt user to keep asking for score until i==n
    {
        scores[i] = get_int("Score %i: ", i + 1);     
    }

    printf("Average: %.1f\n", average(n, scores)); //n = len of array, scores = name of array, .1 shows 1 decimal
}


float average(int length, int array[])             //returns float fx named average - create average. In C, arrays do not remember own length
{
    int sum = 0;                                   //start counting from 0
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        sum += array[i];  //sum = sum + next item in array - get bracket 1+2+3 to sum
    }
    return (float)sum/(float)length;               //want decimals in your score (do not divide int by int)
}
